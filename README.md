Installation
============

## Primary Tools ##

These are the core tools configured by the dotfiles, and are essential
components of a base system.  Omission is unforgivable.

 - git
 - vim
 - tmux
 - ssh
 - zsh

## Secondary Tools ##

These tools are also configured by the dotfiles, but are not necessarily
essential to a base system.  Many of them pertain to communication.
Omission is acceptable and sometimes wise.

 - ranger
 - irssi
 - mutt
 - gpg
 - khal

## Dependencies ##

These programs are required by the primary and secondary tools, as
configured in these dotfiles.

 - make
 - cmake
 - python
 - flake8
 - inconsolata
 - powerline-fonts
 - ctags
